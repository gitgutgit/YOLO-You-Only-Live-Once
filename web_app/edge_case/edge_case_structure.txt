EDGE-CASE FOLDER STRUCTURE
==========================

This file explains the structure created by auto_edge_case_finder.py.

edge_case_auto/
    false_positive/
        - Images where the model predicted something that does NOT actually exist
    false_negative/
        - Images where the ground-truth object exists but the model failed to detect it
    misclassified/
        - Images where the model detected the object but predicted the WRONG class
    low_iou/
        - Images where class was correct but IoU is below threshold (default 0.5)

Each folder contains images copied from your dataset that represent problematic YOLO predictions.

You can inspect these images to understand:
    - Where the model struggles
    - What patterns cause errors
    - Which cases require more training data

This helps improve model robustness and create real "edge-case training sets."
